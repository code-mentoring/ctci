# Object Oriented Design Questions

## 7.1 - Deck of Cards
Design the data structures for a generic deck of cards. Explain how you would subclass the data structures to implement blackjack.

## 7.2 - Call Center
Imagine you have a call center with three levels of employees: respondent, manager, and director. An incoming telephone call must be first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the respondent can't handle the call, they must escalate the call to a manager. If the manager is not free or not able to handle it, then the call should be escalated to a director. Design the classes and data structures for this problem. Implement a method `dispatchCall()` which assigns a call to the first available employee.

## 7.9 - Circular Array
Implement a CircularArray class that supports an array-like data structure which can be efficiently rotated. If possible, the class should use a generic type (also called a template), and should support iteration via the standard `for (Obj o : circularArray)` notation.
