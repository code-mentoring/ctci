You might need to keep your forked repo up to date with the code-mentoring repo as it moves along.
It's good practice anyway when working on forked repos.

* Set an upstream repo:
  * git remote add upstream https://github.com/code-mentoring/ctci.git
* Verify:
  * git remote -v
* Fetch code-mentoring changes:
  * git fetch upstream
* Then merge them into your local:
  * git merge upstream/main
* Then update your remote fork:
  * git push
