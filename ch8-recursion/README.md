# Chapter 8: Recursion and Dynamic Programming

## 8.1: Triple Step
A child  is  running  up a staircase with n steps  and  can  hop either 1 step,  2 steps, or  3 steps  at  a time.
Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child  can  run  up the stairs.

## 8.2 Robot in a Grid
Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r  rows and  c columns.
The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on  them.
Design an  algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.


## 8.3 Magic Index
A magic index in an array A[e... n-1] is defined to be an index such that A[ i] = i. Given a sorted array of distinct integers, write a method to find a magic index, if one exists, in array A.

FOLLOW UP: What if the values are not distinct?

## 8.4 Power Set
Write a method to return all subsets of a set.

## 8.5 Recursive Multiply
Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using the * operator. You  can  use addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, but you should minimize the number of those operations

## 8.6 Towers of Hanoi
In  the classic  problem of the Towers  of Hanoi, you  have 3 towers and  N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (Le., each  disk sits  on top of an  even larger one). You  have the following constraints: 
1. Only one disk can  be moved at a time. 
2. A disk is  slid off the top of one tower onto another tower. 
3. A disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last using stacks.
